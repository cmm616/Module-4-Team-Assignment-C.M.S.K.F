# Our team is to write a program to print a number of options presented to the user and allow the user to select an option from the list.
  The options should be numbered from 1 â€“ 9; although your team can use less than 9 options, but make sure there are at least 5 options. If the user selects a valid choice, the program should print a short message. The message should include the value that the user typed.
